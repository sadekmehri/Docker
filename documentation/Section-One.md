# Containerization vs Virtualization
In this section, we will discuss the differences between containerization and virtualization, two popular technologies used to deploy and manage applications in modern IT environments.

## What is hypervisor?
A hypervisor is a software or hardware component that enables the creation and management of virtual machines. It allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, providing virtualization of hardware resources. There are two main types of hypervisors:

* **Hypervisor Type 1:** which runs directly on the host hardware to control the hardware and manage guest operating systems. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V Server, and KVM.
* **Hypervisor Type 2:** which runs on an existing operating system and is often referred to as a "hosted" hypervisor. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft Hyper-V (when installed on Windows).

They play a crucial role in server virtualization, enabling efficient utilization of resources, isolation between virtual machines, and flexibility to run multiple operating systems on a single physical server. This technology is widely used in data centers for server consolidation, testing and development, and other applications.

## Key Differences between hypervisor one and two
The main difference between Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors is their architecture and the way they interact with the host operating system and hardware.

**Type 1 Hypervisor:**
- **Benefits:** 
  - Better performance and scalability as it runs directly on the hardware without the overhead of an underlying operating system.
  - Higher security and isolation as it has a smaller attack surface compared to an additional host operating system. That means less software involved between the hypervisor and the physical hardware, it means there are fewer potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

- **Drawbacks:**
    - More complex to manage and configure.
    - Limited support for hardware and devices.

**Type 2 Hypervisor:**
- **Benefits:**
  - Easier to install and use as it runs on an existing operating system.
  - Better support for hardware and devices as it leverages the host operating system's drivers and resources.
  - More flexibility and compatibility with a wide range of operating systems and applications.
- **Drawbacks:**
    - Lower performance and scalability due to the additional layer of the host operating system.
    - Higher resource overhead means performance degradation.
    - Less security and isolation compared to Type 1 hypervisors.


## What is containerization?
Containerization is an operating system-level virtualization method that allows applications to be run in isolated user spaces called containers. It provides a lightweight, portable, and consistent environment for applications to run across different environments, such as development, testing, and production. Containers encapsulate all the dependencies, libraries, and configurations required for an application to run smoothly, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

## What is virtualization?
Virtualization is a technology that enables the creation of multiple virtual instances of a physical resource, such as a server, operating system, storage device, or network. It allows the efficient utilization of resources, isolation between virtual instances, and flexibility to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. Virtualization is widely used in data centers for server consolidation, disaster recovery, and other applications.
